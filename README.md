# No8am Data Mining Final Project
By Michael Hammer and Nadeem Nasimi

## Project Description
We used R to explore data from the course scheduling web site No8am. The data included saved course schedules with attributes such as the time the schedule was created and the courses in the schedule. 

## The Final Report: PaperFinal.html 
The report is in RMarkdown. It starts with a table of contents that allows you to navigate to the various sections. The flow of the report is as follows: introducing our project, cleaning the data, creating datasets for analysis, and using data mining techniques to analyze the data. 

## Viewing the Final Report:
1. Open `PaperFinal.html` in a web browser

## Running our R code:
1. Open `PaperFinal.Rmd` in RStudio
2. Select `Run All` from the `Run` dropdown menu

## Generating RMarkdown
